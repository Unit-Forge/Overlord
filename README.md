## Directory structure

### src/api/

Here is where the API endpoints are defined. Each API has its own folder.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/some-endpoint.model.js

It defines the Mongoose schema and model for the API endpoint. Any changes to the data model should be done here.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/some-endpoint.controller.js

This is the API controller file. It defines the main router middlewares which use the API model.

#### src/api/some-endpoint/some-endpoint.router.js

This is the entry file of the API. It defines the routes using, along other middlewares (like session, validation etc.), the middlewares defined in the `some-endpoint.controller.js` file.

### services/

Here you can put `helpers`, `libraries` and other types of modules which you want to use in your APIs.
